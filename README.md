# **CRAFT**
**Compact genome Representation towards large-scale**

**Alignment-Free daTabase**



Thank you for downloading CRAFT, a tool for Compact Representations of large-scale Alignment-Free genomic/metagenomic sequences daTabase and fast sequence comparisons between sequencing data/long genomic sequences and the compact database.

**Description of the framework of CRAFT:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./new_img/CRAFTworkflow.png"/ width="600" height="300">
</p>

CRAFT is composed of two modules:

(A)	Precompute the compact representations of genomic/metagenomic databases. The compact databases were precomputed to embedding vectors and stored in CRAFT with the following steps: count the co-occurred k-mers of the query sequences with sliding window; based on the co-occurrence of context k-mers, each k-mer is tranformed to a vector (embedding). Current CRAFT stored Refseq representative/complete genome and HMP1-II metagenome databases.

(B)	Fast query for N-nearest neighbors in databases for the input DNA data. When a user input a nucleotide sequencing data or a long DNA sequence, the query sequence(s) will be transformed to embedding vector and calculate the distance with the reference database, and output the top N-nearest neighbors in the database. When a user input the query of an unknown sequencing data or a long genomic sequence, CRAFT fast returns the top 10 nearest neighbors from the precomputed compact database which has smallest dissimilarity with the query data.

CRAFT compacts representation of reference sequences with GloVe[1], an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. CRAFT works with sequence data, both long genomic sequences and shotgun sequence reads from NGS technologies, embeds sequences into vector representation for easy storage and comparison.

CRAFT provides three types of visualized downstream analysis, including the distance bar graphe, two-dimension projection using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and sequence clustering into a rounded dendrogram by using the neighbour-joining algorithm.

All the analysis can be performed by simply clicking through well-designed graphical user interface (GUI) on two common operating systems (Linux and Windows) .

Three pre-computed compact databases
============


Currently, we pre-compacted the three databases

(1) All the 139,576 Refseq assembly nucleotide genomes, updated by June, 2018. The size of the database is compacted from 829.60GB(.fa) to 3GB.--*(Since this database requires 3GB of space, it is not included in the zip file. During the running of CRAFT, if the user selected the button of "Refseq complete genome", the download webpage will be automatic linked or [**here**](https://github.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/blob/master/download-refseq.md)  to download and save in ./CRAFT-linux-x64/Refseq folder or ./CRAFT_wins_1.0/Refseq. )*

(2)The 7,106 Refseq representative nucleotide genomes, updated by June, 2018. The size of the database is compacted from 376.38GB(.fa) to 148M.--*(This database is included in the zip file.)*

(3)The 2,355HMP1-II metagenomic samples, which includes **309 skin samples, 234 Vaginal samples, 1,259 Oral samples and 553 Gutsamples,** from 7.13TB (.sra) to 50.4 MB. The sample information is [**here**](https://github.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/blob/master/HMP1-II-info.txt).--*(This database is included in the zip file.)*

Direct Running  on Linux
------------------------
CRAFT has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu14/16/18, Debian 9, CentOS 7, Fedora 29 and Oracle Server 7.6). Because of system difference of Linux, some dll files might not be included. We have included the missing dll files during our testing. If other dll files are require, they can be downloaded [**here**](https://github.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/blob/master/linux-so). And copy the missing dll to CRAFT_linux folder.
