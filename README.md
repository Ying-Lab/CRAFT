# CRAFT
## Compact genome Representation towards large-scale Alignment-Free daTabase

Thank you for downloading CRAFT, a tool for Compact Representations of large-scale Alignment-Free genomic/metagenomic sequences daTabase and fast sequence comparisons between sequencing data/long genomic sequences and the compact database.CRAFT parses the input genomic/metagenomic sequences, counts the co-occurrences of adjacent k-mer pairs, learns the embeddings, searches against archived repositories by the dissimilarity between the input and the archived sequences in the embedding space, and finally reports the best matches in various ways.

## Framework of CRAFT

</p>

 **CRAFT includes two key processing steps: *embedding* and *dissimilarity*.**

  Given a genomic/metagenomic sequence as input, *embedding* learns its compact representation by mapping nucleotide sequences into low-dimensional space. In brief, CRAFT counts the co-occurred *k*-mers of the query sequence with *1*-bp step-size sliding windows. Based upon the co-occurrence of adjacent *k*-mers, each *k*-mer is transformed to a vector using the GloVe algorithm[1]. After that, *dissimilarity* calculates the dissimilarities between the query sequence and the sequences in the archived repositories, in terms of their learned compact representations.

CRAFT compacts representation of reference sequences with GloVe[1], an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. CRAFT works with sequence data, both long genomic sequences and shotgun sequence reads from NGS technologies, embeds sequences into vector representation for easy storage and comparison.

CRAFT provides three types of visualized downstream analysis, including the distance bar graphe, two-dimension projection using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and sequence clustering into a rounded dendrogram by using the neighbour-joining algorithm.

All the analysis can be performed by simply clicking through well-designed graphical user interface (GUI) on two common operating systems (Linux and Windows) .

## Three pre-computed compact databases


Currently, we pre-compacted three databases for the fast query of nearest neighbors for the input sequences

(1) All the 139,576 NCBI assembly nucleotide genomes, updated by June, 2018. The size of the database is compacted from 829.60GB(.fa) to 2.93GB.--*(Since this database requires 2.93GB of space, it is not included in the zip file. During the running of CRAFT, if the user selected the button of "NCBI assembly", the download webpage will be automatic linked or [**here**](https://github.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/blob/master/download-refseq.md)  to download and save in ./CRAFT-linux-x64/Refseq folder or ./CRAFT_wins_1.0/Refseq. )*

(2)The 7,106 Refseq representative nucleotide genomes, updated by June, 2018. The size of the database is compacted from 376.38GB(.fa) to 152.67M.--*(This database is included in the zip file.)*

(3)The 2,355 HMP 1-II metagenomic samples, which includes **309 skin samples, 234 Vaginal samples, 1,259 Oral samples and 553 Gutsamples,** from 7.13TB (.sra) to 50.40 MB. The sample information is [**here**](https://github.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/blob/master/HMP1-II-info.txt).--*(This database is included in the zip file.)*

</p>
**The graphical user interface has the layout shown in the above figure, containing five parts in terms of functionality**:

**1、	Red area: Start new session, input query file and run the comparison**:

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/master/new_img/newssion_but.jpg)  :  Select a new database for query for the nearest neighbors of the input sequence.

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/master/new_img/add_but.jpg)  :  Select the input file. The sequence data can be either long genomic sequences or shotgun sequence reads from NGS technologies, with the file extension 'fasta','fasta.gz','fasta.bz2','fa','fa.gz','fa.bz2','fna','fna.gz','fna.bz2','fastq','fastq.gz','fastq.bz2','fq','fq.gz','fq.bz2'

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/master/new_img/run_but.jpg)   :  Run CRAFT to compare the query file with the selected database.

**2、Green area : Select the pre-compact database or build the compact representation your own database to search for the best matches (nearest neighbors) of the query sequences**.

**3、Yellow area : Select the major taxonomical subgroup in the database for comparison**.

Refseq representative database and  NCBI assembly database includes: Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi, Invertebrate, Plant, Vertebrate, Mammalian, Vertebrate other and Viral. The HMP1-II dataset includes: skin, oral, vaginal and gut.

**4、Black area : Select whether to use the branch and bound algorithm to speed up the searching with the price of accuracy, which is optional for in  NCBI assembly database. ( The default is selected.)**

**5、Purple area : Three visualizations of the comparing result**

Including the distance bar graphe, two dimensional projection using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and sequence clustering into a rounded dendrogram by using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Each analysis is shown in the respective tabbed window. The figure can be saved to local disk by clicking the button or right-clicking the mouse**.

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiaxingbai/CRAFT/master/new_img/save_but.jpg) : Save the current figure.

</p>

**7、 Build you own compact database**

CRAFT offers the interface to build the compact dataset for your own data. If select "build your compact database" in green area, you can load your own data and build the compact database. Then CRAFT can query for the nearest neighbors in your own database with "input query file" or calculate the dissimilarity matrix for samples(genomes) in your own dataset. The built database is stored as My_Database/ My_Database by default.

<p align="center">

</p>

**8、 If one dataset has been compressed by CRAFT, then it can be reloaded to CRAFT with "import your prebuilt compact database"**.

<p align="center">
